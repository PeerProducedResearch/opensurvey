    <p>
      {% blocktrans %}
      De-identified data will be made available to the scientific community, and will be distributed with any publications
      that arise from this study. If necessary to protect the privacy of participants, individual bits of data might be
      removed or only shared in aggregate. These data cannot be used to identify participants. Additionally, each
      participant will be given a copy of their own data as part of this study.
      {% endblocktrans %}
    </p>
    <h3>{% trans "How will my data be protected" %}</h3>
    <p>
      {% blocktrans %}
      All data will be stored on a firewall and password-protected on secure project servers of Open Humans & OpenClinica.
      This study does not collect individual identifiers such as name or email addresses. Instead, Open Humans assigns
      each participant a study ID on enrollment.

    <h3>{% trans "Will someone make money off my data" %}</h3>
    <p>

      guidelines.
