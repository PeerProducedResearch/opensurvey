      The Covid Open survey was created by a team of scientists at the Center for Research and Interdisciplinarity (CRI)
      in
      Paris, with collaborating researchers from the USA, Australia, Canada, Costa Rica, India and more! We are
      interested
      in bringing in minds from all over the world, yours included, to come up with great ideas to research this virus.

      When it comes to science, we believe in harnessing the ingenuity of all citizens. We want you to contribute your
      own survey items according to your research questions and interests. This will not only help us develop the study
      to cover the needs and interests of the cohort, but will also help us understand key questions and concerns that
      citizens outside of academia have regarding the pandemic.

      You will need to access the Open Humans forum, where a dedicated section for suggestions has been created. Your
      participation in this forum can not be linked to your answers in the Covid Open survey. You can also create and engage in topics of
      discussions directly on the forum, as well as vote for suggestions others have made!

    <p>
      {% blocktrans %}
      Every fortnight, our team will go through your suggestions, and decide on a few that we could incorporate into our
      next iteration of the survey. We will then send the new set of questions to be reviewed by the Institutional Review
      Board, to make sure it doesn’t go against any legal or ethical regulations. Once we get the green light, we will move
      to code it into the survey.

    <p>
      {% blocktrans %}
      The Covid Open survey is a 5 minute questionnaire created for people who want to help fight the COVID-19 virus from
      the comfort of their home. It consists of a short questionnaire, followed by a daily check-in on how you feel. A
      wide variety of questions are asked, some of which can be answered daily, others that appear on a rolling basis,
      so as to always keep it fresh!

      Our goal? To better understand the virus’ transmission patterns and its effect on physical and mental health. We want
      to understand how the virus spreads, who it affects most, and how it impacts your daily life. We hope this may
      guide public health decisions and medication repurposing in the future.

    <h3>{% trans "How we do it." %}</h3>
    <p>
      {% blocktrans %}
      All data collected is anonymized and goes through the Open Humans platform. We also seek to promote citizen science
      and give you the option to contribute research
      hypotheses that could be implemented in our fast-evolving survey.
