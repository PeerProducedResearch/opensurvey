              As part of this project, we are carrying out an ongoing survey to collect health data on the current
              COVID-19
              pandemic. We are doing this in an open and participatory setting, so that everyone can contribute
              cooperatively and anonymously to support the global effort to contain the COVID-19 pandemic and learn
              lessons
              for the future. While most of the world is in a quarantine situation, the majority of COVID-19 patients
              are at
              home without regular medical monitoring of disease progression, symptoms, recovery or well-being. Data
              from
              patients reporting symptoms at a distance could provide scientists with indications of the different forms
              of
              the disease and possible links to parameters such as medical history, physical and mental health, social
              distancing, etc. The data could also be used to develop a new approach to the management of the disease.
              The survey includes volunteer participants aged 18 years and older. You will be asked to answer a survey
              every
              day for 2-5 minutes each day, during the pandemic period and until the end of May 2022, with questions
              about
              the symptoms you are experiencing, how you are doing and some details about your medical history and
              demographics.
              You will be able to access your data at any time, as well as all anonymized data acquired in this study.
              In
              addition, as a participant, you will be invited to suggest and discuss new survey questions in an
              anonymous
              participant forum. Neither answering the survey questions or participation in the forum discussions are
              compulsory.

              Participation in this study will not provide you with any direct personal benefit, but may provide
              scientists
              with new data. Although the risk is minimal, the individual survey questions can sometimes be intrusive.
              You
              may, of course, choose not to answer these questions, skip them, or terminate your participation. Your
              involvement is voluntary; refusal to participate will not result in any penalties or loss of benefits to
              which
              you are entitled, and you can end your participation (and/or request that your previous data be deleted)
              at
              any time without consequence.

              The study takes place from 1 June 2020 to 31 May 2022. You can stop participating at any time before the
              end

              The research is conducted via an online or SMS survey, a platform to access your data and an anonymous

              to discuss new survey items that should be added. Take as much time as you wish before making a decision.
